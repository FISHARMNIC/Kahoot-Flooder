# Kahoot-Flood

#### A moderately fast? Resource-Intesive Kahoot! flooder

###### How to Use
---
- Download Executer.js and Faster.js
- Make sure you've installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer)
- In Executer.js, change where it says "\[FASTER.JS GLOBAL FILE LOCATION]" to wherever Faster.js is located
- Run Executer.js and make sure to have terminal open when you are ready to kill (use: killall/taskkill node)
- Change according launcher numbers (number of bots * 5) in Executer.js. On my "decent" 2013 2.6 Dual-Core i5 with 8gb DDR3 macbook I can get more than 50
- Change Game ID in Faster.js
- Run at your own risk (it's safe, just remeber that it runs on your own pc so you can't just run like 9000 bots)
